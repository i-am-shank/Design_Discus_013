## design decisions or assumptions
- In 1990s layouts, we've mostly used HTML and a minimum inline CSS, just for text formatting & preventing UI from crashing out in different screen sizes.
  ![1990s](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/327a7f0f-6d08-45bc-a0af-3ebdc6dec858)
  
- In 2000s layouts, incorporated CSS standards like pseudo classes, media queries to make UI a little interactive to user activities.

- In 2010s layouts, we've used CSS frameworks like Tailwind, as they've come into existence in that era only. Also we've made the layouts responsive, for different screen sizes.

- In 2020s layouts, incorporated some CSS animations/keyframes, minimalism into layouts. Also used some custom fonts from sources like Google Fonts.
  ![2030s](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40ffa9a6-6ace-4d99-9908-3ad322b54ef3)

- In 2030s layouts, we've tried to use futuristic design concepts such as paper morphism, high contrast, etc.
